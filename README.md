Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a systematic application that uses engineering principles, methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems. software engineering is important as it has improved communication for example an mobile application like instagram


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages like fortran 
software engineering being established as a discipline 
the rise of agile methodologies which is focused on flexibility and collaboration


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- this is the gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design- this is the creation of a high level and detailed designs of sostware architecture and user interface
Implementation-writing a code according to the design specification one made 
Testing- this is where one conducts tests to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirements
Deplyoment- releasing the made software to users
Maintenanace-providing ongoing support and updates after the deplyoment 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- is a sequantial approach with distinct phases for example in a software development cycle when it moves from requirements to design to implementation
Agile- iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibilty .collaboration and responding to change an exmaple scrum where a team develop software increments of the new functionality


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer-writes codes and implements software solutions
quality assuarance engineer- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
project manager- overseas the planni g, execution and delivery of sosftware projects in a software engineering team


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- they provide comprehensive tools that enable writting ,debugging and testing codes for example Eclipse
VCS-They are software tools that are used for tracking changes to source code and coordination of work among members of a team for example Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines and this can be overcomed by regular reavulation of timelines 
changing requirements-use of agile methodologies since it is less rigid as compared to waterfall method incase a requirement changes 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit test-this is where the small testable parts are scrutinized if they work properly
integration test-this is where components of the software are gradually intergrated and then tested as a whole
system test-this is the testing the whole complete and fully intergrated system
acceptance test-this is a test that is done to make sure the application meets the users approval 
this tests are important as they ensure they meet user standards and they help the developer validate the capabilities of the system

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is being able to create a question or statement to get the best possible answer from an AI model . the importance of AI engineering is that it enables us  to make a clear question that an AI can understand what you need and not get a vague answer 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me more about computers 
could you tell me when the first computer was invented ,who invented it and highlight six functions of a computer
